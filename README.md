This is a password generator in Lua with a password-saving functionality. It will generate a secure password based on how long you want the password and it will then save it in a list, along with the corresponding website or service the password is for. The list will be saved in the documents folder if you choose to save it. It can also detect duplicate password entries (and ignore or overwrite the duplicate password) and tells you if your password is too short. It's really simple to use (i hope) and it works with Mac, Linux and Windows.

The password saving option isn't really safe since it saves the passwords and the website name as text. So if you actually want to use this, don't. I just made it for learning purposes

Use this script everywhere you want, you can change it and share it idc

Sorry for the shitty GitHub page, i have never done this before ðŸ˜›
