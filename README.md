This is a password generator in Lua. It has a password-saving functionality if you give it the name of the website you'd like to save the password to. It will save it in the documents folder on Mac/Linux/Windows if you choose to save it. It can also detect duplicate password entries and ignore or overwrite the password in this case. It's pretty simple and i added colors to better understand if all went right, if there is a complication (like a duplicate password) or if there is an error.

Use this script everywhere you want, you can change it and share it idc
