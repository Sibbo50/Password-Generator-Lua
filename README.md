## Password generator Lua 
This is a password generator in Lua with a password-saving functionality. It will generate a secure password based on how long you want the password and it will then save it in a list, along with the corresponding website or service the password is for. 

**Use this script everywhere you want, you can change it and share it idc**

### Features

- Option for saving passwords to a txt file in your documents folder
- Detection duplicate password entries (and ignore or overwrite the duplicate password)
- unsafe password warning
- adding names or descriptions to passwords

> The password saving option isn't really safe since it saves the passwords and the website name as text. So if you want to save your passwords, they will be saved as plain text which can be read by anyone with aceess to the PC. I just made it for learning purposes

### Usage

**works with Mac, Linux and Windows**

**You can use [Zero Brane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com/download?not-this-time) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the [Lua extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)) or a compiler of your choice to run the script**
> online compilers will not work since you cant save the passwords and because the script is interactive
