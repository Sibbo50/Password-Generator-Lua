This is a passwords generator in Lua. It has a password saving functionality if you give it the name of the website youd like to save the password to. It will save it in the documents folder on Mac/Linux/Windows if you choose to save it. I can also detect duplicate password entries and irgnore or overwrite the password in this case. Its pretty simple and i added colors to better understand if all went right, if there is a complication (like a duplicate password) or if there is an eroor.
